# LeetCode Journey

This repository documents my personal LeetCode journey. I’ve been solving problems consistently and building my skills day by day.

## 💪 Consistency

I solve **3 LeetCode questions every single day**, no excuses. This habit has helped me steadily improve my problem-solving ability and confidence in Data Structures & Algorithms.

## 📈 Experience

I have already completed many questions before creating this repository. This README isn’t the start of my journey — it’s a continuation of the work I’ve already put in.

## 🎯 Goal

Stay consistent, improve pattern recognition, and prepare for top-tier coding interviews.

More structure, progress tracking, and categorized problem lists will be added soon as I continue my daily practice.
